It has been really long since I blogged anything. The primary reason was that blogging and searching through the existing blog had become tougher than required. Probably because of Hugo and the theme that I selected in it.

Spent today shifting sahil.cc back from hugo to hexo. Ended up paying a heavy price for not sticking as closely as possible to the Markdown spec (and depending hugo/hexo specific plugins instead).

For Hexo theme, it was a close call between [Hexo Next](https://github.com/theme-next/hexo-theme-next) and [Icarus](https://github.com/ppoffice/hexo-theme-icarus). Finally Hexo Next won out for its ease of use.

Now live at https://www.sahil.cc
